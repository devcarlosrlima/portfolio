const jobSummary = `
  My name is Carlos Lima, I was born in 1997 and I am 26 years old. I started programming at the age of 20, creating landing pages for family and friends as a hobby. I did it because I enjoyed it. It was only in 2023, when I was about to turn 25, that I started taking it seriously. I began studying how software works and how I could reach that level. I dedicated myself and really studied programming languages, finding it quite easy to learn them. I think I have a talent for this, but I also like to believe that effort and hard work helped a lot. It didn't take me long to master some languages like Java and JavaScript, as well as frameworks like React.
  
  Currently, I am studying Software Engineering at Faculdade Ampli. I hope to graduate soon and get my diploma, but more than that, I hope to work at a good company and put into practice everything I've studied and practiced, both during my solo studies and my time at the university.
